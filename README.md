# Project 3: Around The U.S.

A page made for posting images about the United States. People here can post images, edit their profile and like other users posts.
In this project we will see a grid layout, to make the website responsive in differents resolutions.

As we can see in the link above, with the autofit value and 282px of width, the cards will fit in the center of the page (of course with other properties).

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
